# ðŸ§© Locky Rust SDK

[Locky](https://getloc.ky) is a cloud-based key-management system focused on preventing
harvest-now decrypt-later quantum attacks.

**Standardized**: Utilizes NIST-approved post-quantum cryptographic parameters and algorithms (FIPS-203)<br>
**Fast**: Keys are retrieved in under 50ms<br>
**Secure**: Root keys are 'split up'. If an entire datacenter's data were compromised, no keys would be exposed<br>
**Reliable**: No downtime even facing a catastrophic datacenter loss<br>
**Flexible**: Locky can be used to store keys for AES, ChaCha20, Ascon, and most other data encryption algorithms<br>
